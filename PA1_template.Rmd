## Introduction

This is an R Markdown document, created for the Coursera course "Reproducible Research", in completion of "Peer Assessment 1". The assignment requires students to write an R markdown document evidencing literate programming, using markdown and R programming techniques. There are 5 primary questions to be answered, dealing with processing and analysing data. The data provided to be worked upon, is called "activity monitoring data".

### The Data

The data provided for use, is derived from a study whereupon a single individual wore a "personal activity monitoring device". The study says that:

> "[Activity monitoring devices] are part of the “quantified self” movement – a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. But these data remain under-utilized both because the raw data are hard to obtain and there is a lack of statistical methods and software for processing and interpreting the data."
The device used in this particular data set collects data on the number of steps taken by an individual, in 5 minute intervals. Two months of data, October/November 2012 are included within the data set. The variables measured include steps (the number of steps taken), date (the day on which the steps measurement was taken) and interval, (the interval in which the steps measurement was taken.) The data is stored in csv format, with 17,598 observations and the aforementioned 3 variables recorded.

## Completing the Assignment

### Question 1: Loading and preprocessing the data

The data must be in the user's current working directory for the code to run correctly. The unzip function extracts the data from the zip file, before it is read into R. The object classes contained within each of the variables are defined, so as to speed up the reading process.

```{r} 
unzip("./activity.zip")
activityData <- read.csv("./activity.csv")
```

An initial look at the data confirms its dimensions and contents.

```{r} 
summary(activityData)
names(activityData)
```

### Question 2: What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

The question states any missing values in the data set can be ignored. From using the summary functions previously, it is already known that there are NA values within the steps variable, so these can be removed now.

```{r}
stepsPerDay <- aggregate(steps ~ date, activityData, sum, na.rm=TRUE)
```

Now that the NA values have been replaced, a histogram from the imputed data can be created. This histogram should indicate the frequency of the total number of steps taken per day. Therefore again, the data must be grouped and "summed" by day.

Creating the histogram:

```{r}
hist(stepsPerDay$steps)
```

### Question 3: What is the average daily activity pattern?

To look at the average daily pattern, we can use another exploratory graph, this time a time series plot. As this plot should look at the average number of steps taken for each interval, (utilising all days), the aggregate function must be used again, to split the data into groups for each interval, and then averaged with the mean function.

```{r}
meanStepsPerDay <- mean(stepsPerDay$steps)
meanStepsPerDay
```

```{r}
medianStepsPerDay <- median(stepsPerDay$steps)
medianStepsPerDay
```

```{r}
stepsPerInterval<-aggregate(steps~interval, data=activityData, mean, na.rm=TRUE)
plot(steps~interval, data=stepsPerInterval, type="l")
```

```{r}
intervalWithMaxNbSteps <- stepsPerInterval[which.max(stepsPerInterval$steps),]$interval
intervalWithMaxNbSteps
```

```{r}
totalValuesMissings <- sum(is.na(activityData$steps))
totalValuesMissings
```

```{r}
getMeanStepsPerInterval<-function(interval){
    stepsPerInterval[stepsPerInterval$interval==interval,]$steps
}
```

So the interval with the maximum number of steps is interval **835**.

### Question 4: Imputing missing values

As the data can be confirmed to contain some NA values as some of the observations:

```{r}
activityDataNoNA<-activityData
for(i in 1:nrow(activityDataNoNA)){
    if(is.na(activityDataNoNA[i,]$steps)){
        activityDataNoNA[i,]$steps <- getMeanStepsPerInterval(activityDataNoNA[i,]$interval)
    }
}
```

```{r}
totalStepsPerDayNoNA <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data=activityDataNoNA, sum)
hist(totalStepsPerDayNoNA$steps)
```

```{r}
meanStepsPerDayNoNA <- mean(totalStepsPerDayNoNA$steps)
medianStepsPerDayNoNA <- median(totalStepsPerDayNoNA$steps)
```


It is therefore shown by the above table, that in the initial data set, missing observations are due to entirely missed days, (8 of the days) where no measurements were made whatsoever. This therefore reinforces that the imputing technique used, of utilising average interval data, was likely more useful than potentially using average daily data.


### Question 5: Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

The question indicates that the imputed data set should be used to answer this problem.  
To help in answering this question, firstly a new factor variable should be created within the data frame. This should indicate whether each day is a "weekday" or a "weekend".

```{r}
activityDataNoNA$date <- as.Date(strptime(activityDataNoNA$date, format="%Y-%m-%d"))
activityDataNoNA$day <- weekdays(activityDataNoNA$date)
for (i in 1:nrow(activityDataNoNA)) {
    if (activityDataNoNA[i,]$day %in% c("Saturday","Sunday")) {
        activityDataNoNA[i,]$day<-"weekend"
    }
    else{
        activityDataNoNA[i,]$day<-"weekday"
    }
}
stepsByDay <- aggregate(activityDataNoNA$steps ~ activityDataNoNA$interval + activityDataNoNA$day, activityDataNoNA, mean)
```

```{r}
names(stepsByDay) <- c("interval", "day", "steps")
library(lattice)
xyplot(steps ~ interval | day, stepsByDay, type = "l", layout = c(1, 2), 
    xlab = "Interval", ylab = "Number of steps")
```
